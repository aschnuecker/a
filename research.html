			<h4> Disentangling Covid-19, Economic Mobility, and Containment Policy Shocks, with Malte Rieth <a href = 'https://papers.tinbergen.nl/21018.pdf' target = _blank> [Working paper] </a>  <a href = 'CamehlRieth2021Appendix.pdf' target = _blank> [Online Appendix] </a> </h3>
			<p> Abstract:  We study the dynamic impact of Covid-19, economic mobility, and containment policy shocks. We use Bayesian panel structural vector autoregressions with daily data for 44 countries, identified through sign and zero restrictions. Incidence and mobility shocks raise cases and deaths significantly for two months. Restrictive policy shocks lower mobility immediately, cases after one week, and deaths after three weeks. Non-pharmaceutical interventions explain half of the variation in mobility, cases, and deaths worldwide. These flattened the pandemic curve, while deepening the global mobility recession. The policy tradeoff is 1 p.p. less mobility per day for 9% fewer deaths after two months.</p>
			
			<h4> Penalized Estimation of Panel Vector Autoregressive Models: A Lasso Approach <a href = 'https://repub.eur.nl/pub/122072/EI2019-33.pdf' target = _blank> [Working paper] </a></h3>
			<p> Abstract: This paper proposes LASSO estimation specific for panel vector autoregressive (PVAR) models. The penalty term allows for shrinkage for different lags, for shrinkage towards homogeneous coeficients across panel units, for penalization of lags of variables belonging to another cross-sectional unit, and for varying penalization across equations. The penalty parameters therefore build on time series and cross-sectional properties that are commonly found in PVAR models. Simulation results point towards advantages of using the proposed LASSO for PVAR models over ordinary least squares in terms of forecast accuracy. An empirical forecasting application with five countries support these findings. </p>

			<h4> Restrictions Search for Panel Vector Autoregressive Models <a href = 'https://www.diw.de/documents/publikationen/73/diw_01.c.545784.de/dp1612.pdf' target = _blank> [Working paper] </a></h3>
			<p> Abstract: The paper introduces the stochastic search variable selection for panel vector autoregressive models (SSVSP). The proposed selection prior allows for a data-based restriction search ensuring the estimation-feasibility.  The SSVSP differentiates between domestic and foreign variables, thereby allowing a flexible panel structure and extending Koop and Korobilis's S4 to a restriction search on single elements. Absent a matrix structure for restrictions, a Monte Carlo simulation shows that SSVSP outperforms S4 in terms of deviation from the true values. Furthermore, a forecast exercise for G7 countries demonstrates that forecast performance improves for SSVSP focusing on sparsity in form of no dynamic interdependencies. </p>
